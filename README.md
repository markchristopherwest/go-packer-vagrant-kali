# Go-Packer-Vagrant-Kali-Vmw

A Vagrant Box for Kali a la VMware Provider

## Foreward

Many people use Kali.  Many people use VMware.  Many people use Vagrant.  Kali creates VMware images in 7zip.  Vagrant Cloud does not contain very many current Kali images.  Wouldn't it be great if everyone on my team could spin up a Vagrant environment that included Kali for testing?

### Preflight Checklist

You should have the following things installed:

```
VMware Fusion (developed & tested using version 11)
Go (you can install using homebrew)
Packer (you can install using homebrew)
Vagrant (you can install using homebrew)
Keka (you can swap this for 7zip & install either using homebrew)
vmrun (comes with VMware so youa re good to if you've got desktop aka fusion)

```
